<font size="4"><p>Well, history is part of a bigger group of subjects known as <b>Social Science</b>. Most parts of Social Science tell us about<br> the world in the present but history helps us understand <b>how the present has evolved</b>. It tells us about the<br< past of the present.</p>
<p>Can you, for instance, think of a society in which cultivation of crops was unknown? Can you imagine life<br> without fire or electricity? Or, what it was to live at a time when roads and railways did not exist,<br> yet people travelled long distances? History can take us into these pasts. History can open doors to such worlds.<br> In this sense, <b>history is an adventure. It is a journey across time and space.</b></p>
